  bio: Ramón is a Chilean kids' coding instructor and freelance software dev. He likes to introduce people to coding more than he enjoys coding itself. If you want pointless Nintendo trivia, look no further than Ramón! He most likely wouldn't love his career as much as he does were it not for the conferences and their respective communities.
