  bio: Ramón is a kids' coding instructor from Chile and freelance software dev. He likes to introduce people to coding more than he enjoys coding itself. If you want pointless Nintendo trivia, look no further than Ramón! He most likely wouldn't love his career as much as he does were it not for the conferences and their respective communities.

  bio: Pilar is a strange, small human that is trying to make the world a better place and bring people happiness. She spends a lot of her time telling computers what to do. She is passionate about dogs and videogames and that’s probably why Pilar can’t stop adopting dogs or talking about videogames. Her biggest strength is being very open-minded and empathetic and that allows her to make things comfortable for everyone. A secret? She is an undercover dog.
