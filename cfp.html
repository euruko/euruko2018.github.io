            </h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <strong>Awesome! We’re delighted you’re interested in giving a talk at EuRuKo.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>You’ll be joining over 16 years of tradition in inspiring and amazing Rubyists and other developers around Europe.</p>
            <p>A few things to note:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>EuRuKo is a non-profit event.</li>
                <li>All talks will have to adhere to our <a href="/coc">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
                <li>We are fully committed to have a lineup as diverse as we can.</li>
                <li>As a non-profit event, we cannot offer to pay you for speaking. We can, however, cover travel and accommodation (see the perks section).</li>
                <li>We will dedicate a few slots for invited speakers such as Matz. Invited speakers are not paid a fee either, but do not have to go through the CfP process.</li>
                <li>The selection will be done with a two-round process, starting with a blind selections
                    (more details <a href="http://cfp.euruko2018.org/events/euruko2018">here</a>)</li>
                <li>The CFP closes on <strong>the 17th of April 2018</strong>, so don't dawdle for too long!</li>

            <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">What can I talk about?</h1>
            <p>Not sure what to talk about? Don’t worry! We’ve got years of EuRuKos’ worth of inspiration for you to take a gander at:</p>
            <p><a href="https://euruko2017.org/schedule/">https://euruko2017.org/schedule/</a></p>
            <p><a href="http://euruko2016.org/schedule">http://euruko2016.org/schedule</a></p>

            <p>And besides, we’re always here to help.</p>
            <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">Speaker assistance</h1>
            <p>If you’re a first time speaker and thinking EuRuKo is out of your reach, you’re mistaken! We encourage first-time speakers to use EuRuKo as a springboard for a career of awesome talks!</p>
            <p>Ruby’s in the name, so Ruby should be the game! Rails talks are cool, of course, but the content of the conference is framework-agnostic. And hey, if you’ve got a non-Ruby or ‘for Rubyists’ talk in mind, send it our way!</p>
            <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">The perks</h1>
            <p>What do you get as a speaker, I hear you asking? Aside from having free entry to the conference (which really barely counts as a perk!), if you’re selected as a speaker, here’s what we can offer you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will cover travel and accommodation for you. However, since we're a non-profit event, if your employer offers a budget for travel and accommodation we kindly ask you to use that. This way we can use our budget for the speakers that don't have these benefits. Should you have any questions or feedback, please let us know at euruko2018@gmail.com.</li>
                <li>Please let us know how we can help you out otherwise!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For details and the submission procedure, please take a look at our CFP app:</p>
