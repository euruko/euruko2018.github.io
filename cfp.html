            <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">What can I talk about?</h1>
            <p>Not sure what to talk about? Don’t worry! We’ve got years of EuRuKos’ worth of inspiration for you to take a gander at:</p>
            <p><a href="https://euruko2017.org/schedule/">https://euruko2017.org/schedule/</a></p>

            <p>And besides, we’re always here to help.</p>
            <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">Speaker assistance</h1>
            <p>If you’re a first time speaker and thinking EuRuKo is out of your reach, you’re mistaken! We encourage first-time speakers to use EuRuKo as a springboard for a career of awesome talks!</p>
            <p>Ruby’s in the name, so Ruby should be the game! Rails talks are cool, of course, but the content of the conference is framework-agnostic. And hey, if you’ve got a non-Ruby or ‘for Rubyists’ talk in mind, send it our way!</p>
            <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">The perks</h1>
            <p>What do you get as a speaker, I hear you 🤔’ing? Aside from having free entry to the conference (which really barely counts as a perk!), if you’re selected as a speaker, here’s what we can offer you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will cover travel and accommodation for you. If your employer can cover your travel and accommodation though, that’d be amazing! You could even show them on a slide!</li>
                <li>Please let us know how we can help you out otherwise!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For details and the submission procedure, please take a look at our CFP app:</p>
