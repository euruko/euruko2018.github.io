          <p>The facts:</p>
          <ul style="padding: 20px 30px;">
            <li>The venue is easily accessible by public transportation(we need to check this!)</li>
            <li>The hotel and the restrooms are wheelchair-accessible. Sadly there's no elevator to the balustrade of the ballroom</li>
            <li>We're working to get a stenographer in order to offer a live translation but we cannot guarantee that at this point</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We're taking the well-being of every attendee really serious. Please let us know on twitter or via email if we can help you in any way.</p>
