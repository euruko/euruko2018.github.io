      <h2 style="margin-top: 20px" >By plane</h2>
      <p>When landing at Vienna International Airport, there are two different train lines you can take to get into Vienna:</p>
      <ul style="padding: 20px 30px;">
        <li><p>CAT (City airport train): The CAT goes non-stop from the airport to Wien Mitte/Landtrasse.
          You can purchase a ticket <a href="https://www.cityairporttrain.com/en/home">here</a> for EUR 11,00.
          (NOTE: Purchasing a regular train ticket (see below) is not a valid CAT ticket)</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>S7/RJ (OEBB): The regular railway train makes several stops along the way into Vienna. The trip would take approx.
            12 minutes longer, but cost only one ticket zone's worth (EUR 2,40.- at the time of writing).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note: For both of these options, an additional zone ticket is required inside Vienna. We recommend purchasing this at the airport.</strong>
      </p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 50px" class="section-header align-self-start">Getting around Vienna</h1>
      <p>Each trip inside Vienna requires a valid ticket. There is only one zone inside of Vienna. Getting from and to the airport will
        require an extra zone ticket (see above).</p>
      <p>Purchasing tickets can either be done at each underground station (represented by the big &quot;U&quot;) or online at the <a href="https://shop.wienerlinien.at/index.php/tickets">Wiener Linien</a> website (Link to the english version of the website is at the top, but not linkable, it seems!).</p>
      <p>For finding routes, we recommend using the online <a href="https://m.qando.at/">Qando platform</a> (also in English! Link in menu).</p>
