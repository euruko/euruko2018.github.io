We are so tremendously excited to share with you that our full lineup has been confirmed. No EuRuKo would be
a real EuRuKo without "Matz", so this year's edition will not disappoint.

This year you'll have the pleasure to see talks from our 2 invited speakers, Joannah Nanjekye & Nadia Odunayo,
which have happily agreed to join us from Kampala Uganda, and London respectively.

It wasn't easy to select the best and the most varied combination of talks from our CfP platform, but we think
we've put together a very nice schedule for you guys with the help of our 10 speakers coming from the most
interesting locations, companies, and domains of activity.

If you haven't seen it yet, check out our [speakers page](/speakers).

Cheers,
the EuRuKo team
