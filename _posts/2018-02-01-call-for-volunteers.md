Are you interested in helping out at EuRuKo?

We're absolutely delighted that you want to help out. If you're interested [drop us an email](mailto:euruko2018@gmail.com) or [send us a tweet](https://twitter.com/euruko) and we'll get in contact with you.

A few things you'll need to know about:

- EuRuKo is open to everyone. Don't know much or any Ruby? That's totally cool!
- By volunteering at EuRuKo, you're representing the conference as well as the community. As such, you will need to abide by and enforce the [code of conduct](https://euruko2018.org/coc/). Failure to do so will mean you won't be able to volunteer.
- The tasks involved include but aren't limited to: Registration, helping speakers, floating around the hall to assist attendees, and more.
- We want you to be able to attend the talks you want to see! We'll therefore try and create a shift schedule that works for as many folks as possible.

Join the core team and we will invite you to our Slack team and share our tasks board with you.
If you're interested [drop us an email](mailto:euruko2018@gmail.com) and we'll get in contact with you.
