We need you! Do you want to help organising the next edition of EuRuKo? 
You don't need to know Ruby in order to contribute. Our tasks range from talking
to attendees, sponsors, catering companies, to adding content to the website, 
and generally making sure that everything runs smoothly on the day of the event.


Join the core team and we will invite you to our Slack team and share our tasks board with you.
If you're interested [drop us an email](mailto:euruko2018@gmail.com) and we'll get in contact with you.
