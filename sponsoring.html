            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                EuRuKo wants to be an inclusive conference. That's why we have a Diversity Ticket Programme aimed at members of
                underrepresented groups in tech â€” this includes, but is not limited to: people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, women, disabled people.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                As a Diversity Sponsor you make it possible for one or more eligible candidates to attend the conference by sponsoring their ticket
                and, optionally, their travel and accommodation. Please <a href="mailto:euruko2018@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>
                if you're interested or want to learn more.
